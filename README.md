MailPlan
========

_Note that this is **SUPER ALPHA** software.  This is the result of a few hours of hacking on a Saturday afternoon, mostly to prove the concept and address a very specific need I had.  I will continue to develop it into something more general purpose, but for now, caveat emptor._

MailPlan is a command line mail rules engine written in Python.  MailPlan is not a full fledged email client, and it never will be; there's plenty of competition in that space.  Instead, MailPlan provides a way to define rules to select and perform actions on your emails.  Since the actions are written in Python, you can do pretty much anything you like to your emails, including parsing and automatically downloading linked files and moving or deleting the message itself.  You can even use MailPlan as a *mail delivery agent*, by defining an action that saves messages

# Features

* Command line, scriptable, cron-able mail rules engine.
* Supports IMAP4 over SSL only (for now), including version of IMAP4 supported by Gmail.com.
* Supports arbitrary actions that act on the mail header or message (other info TBD).
* 100% pure Python, with no platform dependencies or compiled libraries.


# Usage

To use MailPlan, you must first define a configuration file.  The configuration file for MailPlan is named .mailplanrc and lives in your home folder (i.e. ~/.mailplanrc).  This file must declare the following sections and properties:

```
[accounts]
enabled=primary

primary.server=mail.server.com
primary.username=me
primary.password=mypass

[rules]
enabled=file

file.select=INBOX
file.search=FROM *@important.com
file.action=file_important
```

The **[accounts]** section contains your email account information.  The *enabled* property allows you to selectively enable and disable accounts without removing the information.  When MailPlan runs, it will evaluate rules for every enabled account.

Each account is defined by a set of properties, prefixed by a name.  In this example, the account name is *primary*, and the properties that must be defined are *server*, *username*, and *password*.  Note that the account name used here must match the account name specified in the *enabled* property.

The **[rules]** section contains your rules to run.  Like with accounts, the *enabled* property allows you to selectively enable and disable rules without removing the information.  When MailPlan runs, it will evaluate every enabled rule.

Each rule is defined by a set of properties, prefixed by a name.  In this example, the rule name is *file*, and the properties that must be defined are:

* *select* - The mailbox to select before searching.
* *search* - The search to use to query messages.  This expressed in standard IMAP4 search criteria format.
* *action* - The action to execute.  This action must exist in the *actions* subfolder.

# Actions

Actions are defined as .py files stored in the *actions* subfolder of MailPlan.  An action can be an arbitrary Python program; the only requirement is that the .py file define an *action* function as an entry point, e.g.:

```
def action(header, message, ops):
	...
```

This function can perform whatever action is required based on the header and message information.  It can use the *ops* parameter to perform IMAP operations on the message, such as fetch, copy, move, and delete.  The action function must return one of the following string values:

* OK - The action was performed correctly and the system can proceed with further processing.
* SKIP - The action was skipped, and the rest of the processing on this message should be skipped.
* ERROR - There was an error performing the action, and the appropriate information should be logged for analysis.
* STOP - The action indicates that the rule should stop processing (i.e. a limit or stop condition was reached).

# Future Plans

* Compose actions from action sequences, directly in .mailplanrc file
* Define reusable set of actions, to use in composed action sequences
* Multiple mailboxes per rule (currently only one mailbox is allowed in the select property)
* Client side search validators
* Full support for X-GM-RAW (currently supports single terms using the gmail: search but does not support composing search from individual clauses)
